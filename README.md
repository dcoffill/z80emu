z80emu
======

Overview
--------
z80emu is an emulator for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor.  This was started as
an experiment/hobby project to write an emulator for a CISC machine, after I
had just written a MIPS simulator for my Advanced Architecture class.
  Additionally, I wanted a chance to mess with some of the fancy C++ features 
I'd never been allowed to use for class projects.


Resources Used

Resources used in creating this emulator include:

[The Undocumented Z80 Documented (PDF)](http://www.z80.info/zip/z80-documented.pdf)
> An excellent writeup of the Z80 by Sean Young.

[Official Zilog User's Manual (PDF)](http://www.zilog.com/force_download.php?filepath=YUhSMGNEb3ZMM2QzZHk1NmFXeHZaeTVqYjIwdlpHOWpjeTk2T0RBdmRXMHdNRGd3TG5Ca1pnPT0=)
> The official user's manual from Zilog.  While it contains several errors but is still a decent reference when combined with additional sources.

[ClrHome Z80 Opcode Table](http://clrhome.org/table/)
> An excellent, interactive table of Z80 opcodes.

[Z80 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80)
> Wikipedia's article on the Z80, which gives a decent, high-level overview of the chip and its features.
